For this visual essay, I am building off my [Data Essay project](https://nadavgiladmuth.github.io/DataEssay/) in which I identified the top ten most common butterfly species observed in Delaware Country from 2020-2025 on the citizen science platform iNaturalist. For the purposes of this assignment, I have decided to explore six of these top ten species and provide information and media about each of these species. The six species are: Eastern Tiger Swallowtail, Monarch, Peck’s Skipper, Eastern Tailed-Blue, Cabbage White, and Zabulon Skipper. As you can see from the embedded chart, species like the Eastern Tiger Swallowtail and the Monarch rank among the most reported species observed, reflecting their abundance during the spring and summertime and their distinct patterns that citizen scientists are more familiar with. Additionally, the chart displays that four out of the ten top species are part of the skipper family, namely: Huron Sachem, Peck’s Skipper, Silver-spotted Skipper, and Zabulon Skipper. These data reveal that Delaware County has a suitable diversity of natural habitats such as meadows, grasslands, and forest edges that skipper species typically reside in. Overall, we can identify many trends relating to the ecological niches Delaware County has to offer and the prevalence of different butterfly species that inhabit the area. The following visual essay will provide more information and statistics about each of these fluttery creatures!




#### Eastern Tiger Swallowtail (Papilio glaucus)

Eastern Tiger Swallowtails are quite prevalent across eastern North America, appearing from spring through early fall. They have a comparatively large wingspan of 3.5–5.5 inches and are often spotted fluttering near forest edges and waterways. This species feeds on nectar from a variety of flowers and uses trees like tulip poplar as host plants. Some females can be yellow or a rare black “dark morph,” which mimics toxic species for protection.

#### Monarch (*Danaus plexippus*)

Seen from late spring to early fall in Delaware County, Monarchs have a wingspan of 3.5–4 inches and are easily identified by their iconic orange and black pattern. They breed exclusively on milkweed, which provides essential toxins for defense and keeps them safe from being a bird’s next meal. These butterflies migrate thousands of miles to overwinter in Mexico and are actually among the few insect species known to complete a two-way migration like birds!

#### Peck's Skipper (Polites peckius)

Peck’s Skippers are typically active from late spring through summer and have a smaller wingspan of 1–1.25 inches. They are most commonly seen in grassy meadows, roadsides, and lawns. Their quick, low flight pattern makes them tricky to spot, by predators and naturalists alike! Peck’s Skippers also display a unique basking behavior, often resting with their forewings and hindwings held at different angles!

#### Eastern Tailed-Blue (*Cupido comyntas*)

The Eastern Tailed-Blue is found from April through October in open habitats including fields and lawn edges. With a wingspan of just 0.75–1 inch, these little guys are extremely difficult to spot, let alone snap a photo of! This species displays sexual dimorphism with males typically having a lighter blue coloration on the upperside of their wings while their female counterparts have a darker, almost charcoal coloring.This species gets its name from the tiny tail-like extensions on its hindwings which are often used to confuse predators into attacking the wrong end of the butterfly, allowing it to escape!

#### Cabbage White (Pieris rapae)

Another iconic species, the Cabbage White is present nearly year-round in the Northeast. With a 1.25–2 inch wingspan, the Cabbage White thrives in both urban and natural spaces. Introduced from Europe in the 19th century, it is now one of the most common butterflies in North America. It lays eggs on cabbage and mustard family plants, hence its name. To determine its sex, look for two black spots on the upper side of its forewings for females, and only one black spot for males!

#### Zabulon Skipper (Lon zabulon)

The Zabulon Skipper favors moist habitats and grasses and can typically be observed around woodland edges, meadows, and shaded trails. With a wingspan of 1–1.5 inches, Zabulon Skippers are active from spring through fall. The Zabulon skipper is often mistaken for the Hobomok Skipper, as they were once considered the same species before naturalists were able to distinguish minor details between the two!
